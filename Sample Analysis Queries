1. Top 3 cancer areas by HPV 16/18 attribution;
SELECT cancer_area, hpv_16_18_attributable
FROM hpv_cancer_stats
ORDER BY hpv_16_18_attributable DESC
LIMIT 3;

2. Age group with the highest HPV prevalence;
SELECT age_range, prevalence_percent
FROM hpv_prevalence_by_age
ORDER BY prevalence_percent DESC
LIMIT 1;

3. Compare total HPV-attributable cases vs. 16/18 attribution;
SELECT 
    SUM(hpv_attributable) AS total_hpv_cases,
    SUM(hpv_16_18_attributable) AS total_16_18_cases,
    ROUND(SUM(hpv_16_18_attributable)/SUM(hpv_attributable)*100, 2) AS percent_16_18
FROM hpv_cancer_stats
WHERE cancer_area != 'Total';
