# HPV_analysis_project

This project explores publicly available data on HPV-attributable cancer cases and prevalence by age. Using MySQL and phpMyAdmin, I cleaned and structured the data, wrote analysis queries, and created visualizations to uncover key trends.

## 💻 Skills Used
- SQL (joins, aggregation, filtering)
- Relational data modeling
- Data cleaning
- phpMyAdmin
- Data visualization (basic charts)

## 📊 Data Sources
- Ourworldindata and public health HPV reports (summarized)
- Two tables: `hpv_cancer_stats` and `hpv_prevalence_by_age`

## 📌 Key Questions Answered
- What are the top 3 cancer types with the highest HPV 16/18 attribution?
- What age group has the highest HPV prevalence?
- How does prevalence change over time?

## 🧭 Project Workflow (Start to Finish)

1. **SQL_syntax_codes.sql** – Created database tables and inserted raw data
2. **Sample_analysis_queries.sql** – Wrote SQL queries to explore and analyze the data
3. **charts/bar_line_pie.visualization** – Exported results and built visualizations from query results
4. **summary_findings.txt** – Summarized key insights for non-technical audiences
