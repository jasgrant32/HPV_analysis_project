This project explores publicly available data on HPV-attributable cancer cases and prevalence by age. Using MySQL and phpMyAdmin, I cleaned and structured the data, wrote analysis queries, and created visualizations to uncover key trends.

## ðŸ’» Skills Used
- SQL (joins, aggregation, filtering)
- Relational data modeling
- Data cleaning
- phpMyAdmin
- Data visualization (basic charts)

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources
- Ourworldindata and public health HPV reports (summarized)
- Two tables: `hpv_cancer_stats` and `hpv_prevalence_by_age`

## ðŸ“Œ Key Questions Answered
- What are the top 3 cancer types with the highest HPV 16/18 attribution?
- What age group has the highest HPV prevalence?
- How does prevalence change over time?
